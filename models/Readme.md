#### Models Folder

Here the trained model weights are saved and read from.   

Because of its large size, I have added the weights to a shared drive directory.   
[Download from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_bpWvKYhV_zT1BHUjU3eUlrYjQ?usp=sharing)

After downloading the weights, your directory structure should look something like this.   
```
models
+--- baseline_model.best_weights.hdf5
+--- manufacturer_model.best_weights.hdf5
+--- unet_128.best_weights.hdf5
```
